      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think that the best thing to start with is, who I expect to want to see my site and why should they want to? From the beginning I have said I wanted this site to be a portfolio in two ways. First, I want this site itself to serve as a proof of what I can do as far as HTML and website building are concerned. This is a good Idea as it comes with it’s own built in why. People who want to see what I can do are the audience, at least partially. I want the website to both show what I can do and show my work.
Second, as I stated I am an aspiring writer and as such I feel it will be prudent to have a place where I can share with any readers I might have useful things like, book release information and maybe even previews of cover art as it comes out. I also want to have a way for people to contact me and host links where they can find any books I might write.
To this end I figured I would design my site to be a bit like my original site, or rather as follows:

      </p>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        On the actual home page I will have a space for book covers, probably arranged in gallery format along with any other images I might wish to put up, like images of any art I have created/ may have commissioned and feel like sharing. I want it to be arranged in a way that it shows my literary accomplishments. A showcase of sorts.
Because this is technically the home page of my site this page will have more info about me and is less an at-a-glance page, and more of the meat-and-potatoes section. It should have anything else I can think of to add at the time, and is the page that I think will have the most potential to have things added to it.
I think this page should also have a place for any outlines or character spots (i.e. characters from my novels and stories that I may write. Content is kind of flexible at this time as I haven’t really completed anything yet.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="img/logo.obg" alt="Homepage Logo">
        <img src="img/Victory.png" alt="Hero Image">

      </ul>
      <h3>Landing</h3>
      <p>
        On the first page, I want it to be kind of like a landing page. It will show my contact information and my logo and will have a link at the top clearly leading to the actual home page. At the bottom it should show any announcements, like novel release dates, as well as any bulletins I would like to give the readers. This puts info from me front and center and allows them to get quick info at a glance and then proceed on to the main page if they would like to see more.
I think every other page should have a common header bar with navigation and a small version of the logo to tie it into the Landing page. This common design language and consistent branding should help tie the site together and make it feel like a cohesive whole.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 2</p>
        <img src="img/Home.png" alt="Home button">
        <img src="img/logo.png" alt="Landing Logo">

      </ul>
      <h3>ContactMe</h3>
      <p>
        The second page is going to be a bit simpler. It will contain more contact information as well as a place to sign up (eventually) for email Newsletters. As a placeholder I will have just my email information as well as a link to my existing website that is hosted and managed by someone I pay.

      </ul>

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        [Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make clear]
      </p>
      <img src="#" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        [Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make clear]
      </p>
      <img src="#" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        [Any additional details about page 3 that the wireframe does not make clear]
